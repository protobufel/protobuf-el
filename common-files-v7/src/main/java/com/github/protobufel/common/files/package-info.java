/**
 * Provides fast and convenient directory and file system scanning and processing.
 * <p>
 * Java 7 and 8 {@link java.nio.file} package provides a basic {@link java.nio.file.PathMatcher}
 * interface and a bare bone implementation. Unfortunately, the algorithm doesn't filter out
 * directories, and only works directly on files for globs and regexes, meaning the processing of
 * <strong>the entire subtree(-s)</strong>!
 * <p>
 * In contrast, the classes of this package, while dealing with the same glob or regexes syntax,
 * will intelligently skip entire directories, if the pattern(-s) are not satisfied. In effect, for
 * the large file trees, the savings would amount to many orders of magnitude!
 * <p>
 * In addition to the efficient processing, there are classes dealing with resources by specifying
 * multiple blob/regex excludes and/or includes; all while using the same efficient algorithm.
