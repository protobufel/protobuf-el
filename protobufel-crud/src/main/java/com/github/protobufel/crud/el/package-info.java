/**
 * <p>
 * Provides basic query processing capabilities using EL 3.0 expression language with a mix of
 * regular objects and ProtoBuf Messages and Builders. 
 * <p><h2>Usage</h2>:
 * Get a list of ProtoBuf Message(s) as an in-parameter, with an optional map of beans, and as the
 * result return a list of ProtoBuf Message(s), processed via EL 3.0 language. This, effectively,
 * can be any CRUD operation, or a combination of thereof.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * List<Message> actual = ProtoMessageQueryProcessor.builder()
 *     .setExpression("(index==0) ? (record.color='RED') : null; record")
 *     .process(originalCityList);
 * </pre>
