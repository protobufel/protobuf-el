/**
 * <p>
 * Provides DynamicMessage and DynamicMessage.Builder with additional capabilities compared to the
 * corresponding original Google Protocol Buffer implementation, and can be used as the drop-in
 * replacement of the originals.
 * <p>
 * In addition to the standard features required of any Message.Builder, DynamicMessage.Builder has
 * the following:
 * <ol>
 * <li>hierarchical builders via getFieldBuilder method
 * <li>almost all extra of the GeneratedMessage.Builder(-s)
 * <li>convenience methods accepting String in place of FieldDescriptor
 * <li>methods for getting and setting attributes and children instead of just any field type
 * <li>flow/navigation support, like toChild and toParent methods
 * <li>automatic invalidation of the root builder and its child builders
 * </ol>
 *
 * Some of these capabilities are essential, and will be used for the adaptation of the Protocol
 * Buffers in JSR-341 EL 3.0 language.
 *
